# AEM HTL REACT
 boiler plate for HTL and React in your AEM instance :)


#NOTE:
 Hello World is the only component touched in this example.
 This uses React@18 if you are using a lower version of react and things does not work consider downgrading the babel packages as we use the babel-loader in webpack to properly compile   
 jsx/react files.
